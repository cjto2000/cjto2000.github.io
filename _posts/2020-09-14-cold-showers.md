title: Cold Showers
---

It's been about half a year since I started religiously taking cold showers. It used to be something that I would do every now and then, but I gradually turned it into a habit and honestly cannot remember the last time I took a warm one. There's extensive literature on the benefits of cold showers, such as improved immune resistance, improved mood, higher levels of alertness, and creation of brown fat. But I am mainly writing this post to reflect on the tangibles I've been able to take away from engaging in the practice (and to also get my first post in :P).

My first-hand experience only has positive remarks about cold showers. I've never been one to experience extreme swings of depression, but whenever I've felt gloomier than usual, I've noticed that cold showers would, in a way, shock me back to reality. It creates shift in focus to the ambient sensations, such as the shock of cold water or my change in breathing pattern. My mind is literally forced to think about something other than why I'm sad.

The second benefit I've noticed virtually immediately after a cold shower is an increased level of awareness and direction in what I plan to do. When I would take warm showers, I would find that my mindset would be centered around comfort, which is not ideal in finding motivation to get work done. I would linger in the shower then lie on my bed. Cold showers, on the other hand, create a higher sense of urgency to leave the shower due to the discomfort. This feeling of urgency is still present even when the shower is over, which propels me in my next endeavor. A cold shower also increases my alertness because that's just how my body reacts when placed in physical discomfort, almost like a fight or flight response.

For those who are skeptical about the benefits of cold showers, I've linked some papers below:

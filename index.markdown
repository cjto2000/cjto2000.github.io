Hi! I'm Justin. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I have worked at [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/) as an SDE Intern, and I have also done extensive work at [DotMote Labs](https://dotmotelabs.com/) as a Software Engineer. This upcoming summer, I will be working at [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as a Machine Learning Intern.

My technical interests often change, but right now, I am mainly interested in machine learning applications. Currently, I'm a research assistant in the [Neural Systems Lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu/) conducting research on neural co-processors - a closed-loop BCI framework that leverages AI to jointly optimize the cost function with the nervous system. 

Besides my technical interests, I'm also interested in tools that help me explore my mind, improve my health, and develop personally.

Here is my resume: [resume](/assets/CS Resume.pdf)

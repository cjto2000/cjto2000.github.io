Hi! I'm Justin. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I have worked at [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/) as an SDE Intern, and I have also done extensive work at [DotMote Labs](https://dotmotelabs.com/) as a Software Engineer. This summer, I am working at [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern, where I will be adding some features to Okta ThreatInsight and Risk Scoring.

My technical interests often change, but broadly speaking, I'm interested in artificial intelligence. At UW, I am an undergraduate research assistant at the [Neural Systems Lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu/) conducting research on neural co-processors. 

Besides my technical interests, I'm interested in tools that help me explore my mind, improve my health, and develop personally. I'm also fascinated by many topics in psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. In my free time, you can catch me at the climbing gym or training brazilian jiu jitsu.

Here is my resume: [resume](/assets/CS Resume.pdf)

Hi! I'm Justin. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Washington planning to major in Computer Science and minor in Entrepreneurship. I've interned at Amazon where I worked on standardizing a data preparation tool, and I've also been working at a startup since the Summer of 2019 where I developed a remote sensing workflow as well as visualization tools for the UI.

My personal interests lie mainly around personal development/self-help. Whether it be through challenging myself physically by learning advanced calisthenics skills or meditating daily to inspect the nature of consciousness, I'm always seeking ways to develop and learn more about myself. This has quite recently led me down interesting topics in Psychology and Neuroscience - neither of which I would have guessed I'd be interested in as an adolescent.

Here is my resume: [resume](/assets/CS Resume.pdf)

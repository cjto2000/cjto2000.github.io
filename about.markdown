Hi! I'm Justin. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I have worked at Amazon as an SDE Intern and currently work at [DotMote Labs](https://dotmotelabs.com/) as a Software Developer. This upcoming summer, I will be working at Okta as a Machine Learning Intern.

My technical interests are always changing, but right now, I am mainly interested in machine learning applications.

My personal interests lie mainly around personal development/self-help. Whether it be through challenging myself physically by learning advanced calisthenics skills or meditating daily to inspect the nature of consciousness, I'm always looking for ways to improve. This has quite recently led me down interesting topics in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy - none of which I would have guessed I'd be interested in as an adolescent.

Here is my resume: [resume](/assets/CS Resume.pdf)

Hi! I'm Justin. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. I have worked at Amazon as an SDE Intern and currently work at [DotMote Labs](https://dotmotelabs.com/) as a Software Developer. This upcoming summer, I will be working at Okta as a Machine Learning Intern.

My technical interests are always changing, but right now, I am mainly interested in machine learning applications.

My personal interests lie mainly around personal development/self-help. Whether it be through challenging myself physically by learning advanced calisthenics skills or meditating daily to inspect the nature of consciousness, I'm always looking for challenging and beneficial things to add to my repertoire.

Here is my resume: [resume](/assets/CS Resume.pdf)
